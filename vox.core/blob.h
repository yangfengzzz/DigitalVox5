/// case, a deleter function is needed to notify the external memory manager
/// that the memory is no longer needed. It does not make sense to infer the
/// total buffer size. For example, if a Tensor has a negative stride size, it
/// is necessary to access memory addresses smaller than Blob's beginning memory
/// address. The only responsibility for Blob is to hold the beginning
/// memory address and it's up to the user to access any addresses around it.

/// - A Blob does not know about its memory size after construction.
/// - A Blob cannot be deep-copied. However, the Tensor which owns the blob can
/// be copied.
